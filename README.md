Java is one of the world's most important and widely used computer
languages, and it has held this distinction for many years. Unlike some
other computer languages whose influence has weared with passage
of time, while Java's has grown.
Java is a high level, robust, object-oriented and a secure and stable
programming language but it is not a pure object-oriented language
because it supports primitive data types like int, char etc.
Java is a platform-independent language because it has runtime
environment i.e JRE and API. Here platform means a hardware or
software environment in which anapplication runs.
Java codes are compiled into byte code or machine-independent
code. This byte code is run on JVM (Java Virtual Machine).
The syntax is Java is almost the same as C/C++. But java does not
support low-level programming functions like pointers. The codes in
Java is always written in the form of Classes and objects.
As of 2020, Java is one of the most popular programming languages in
use, especially for client-server web applications.Its has been
estimated that there are around nine million Java developers inside
the world.
